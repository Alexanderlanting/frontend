            <h2>Fintechs are giving traditional banks a run for their money.</h2>
            <p>Consumers are expressing their appreciation for digital banking with their wallets. Increasingly popular, digital banks can offer faster, more convenient and more affordable financial services when compared to traditional banks. They also set a high bar for personalized customer experiences. Traditional banks have a simple choice: keep up or get out.

                Jeroen Das, Product Owner of Conversational AI at Dutch banking giant ABN AMRO Bank N.V., is well aware of the industry’s shift. “We have a lot of new entrants in the financial industry,” he explains. “They have a competitive edge over the larger, more classical banks that are still transitioning to becoming true digital banks. If banks don’t embrace digitization, I think they will lose relevance to customers pretty rapidly.”

                Bob van Groningen, ABN AMRO’s IT Engineering Lead, agrees: “Digital transformation for banks is really important. I think we must become more digital, without losing the connection with our clients. If we’re not able to do that, customer satisfaction will drop quickly and, if that happens, we will start to lose clients rapidly to all the specialized alternatives that have come up in the industry in the past years.”

                Today, ABN AMRO is on the path to digitization. However, not too long ago, its retail customers had to contact the call center or send emails to get answers to questions. The process was antiquated and time consuming. In 2017, when conversational AI technology was still relatively new in the Dutch market, the bank experimented with chatbot services to gauge customer response. Overall, customers liked the technology. The bank, however, saw its limitations, especially when customer questions or requests deviated from scripted scenarios.
